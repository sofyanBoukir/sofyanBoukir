 I enjoy turning ideas into fast, simple, and useful experiences.

 Here you'll find fragments of my curiosity, experiments, and ambition â€” written in code, shaped by open source, and shared with intention.

 Available for open-source projects using Express.js, TypeScript, Next.js, or React â€” happy to collaborate!
